<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Wow! You are one stage away from completing the project!</p>

<p>To complete this final stage, we recommend using <strong>lifecycle methods</strong>. An alternative way is <strong>Hooks</strong>, which were added to React to provide a more direct API to such concepts as props, state, context, refs, and lifecycle. Even though in general, Hooks may be a better tool, you'll need to rewrite a big portion of your code if you want to use it now. Because of that, and since <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_lifecycle.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">lifecycle methods</a> are a part of React, it would be better to leave Hooks for later and opt for lifecycle methods in this project.</p>

<p>As described earlier,  victory comes after all cells are open and all bombs are flagged. Implement a function that will track it and show that you've won.</p>

<p>Add the reset function that should be launched if the player presses the reset button. Bring some variety to the reset button appearance: change it according to the situation on the field! Check out the example to see how we did it.</p>

<p>Almost there! It's a good idea to add code that will prevent losing after the first click. In other words, if the player's first click was on a cell with a mine, you should call the function to create a new field. The first click shall never be on a mine: it's a classic Minesweeper rule! Finally, make sure that after the game is over, all the mines are displayed on the field.</p>

<p>That's it! You have your own unique version of Minesweeper!</p>

<p>Your intermediate solution can be compiled and run in a browser using the <code class="java">npm start</code> command in the WebStorm terminal; to stop the server, use <code class="java">Ctrl+C</code>.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Reset button</li>
	<li>Remake the field if the first click was on a mine</li>
	<li>After the game is over, all the mines are shown </li>
	<li>Victory condition </li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>In a browser, the result of this step will look something like this:</p>
