<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In this stage, you are going to create all the components of the game. Don’t be scared: here, you will be working only on the visuals! Before you get to work, make sure that you know how to create functional components and use props: you may consult the <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">React library official website</a> if you need to learn or refresh something. Your task is to decide how to break down the game into parts, that is, the components of your app, then use <em>JSX</em> to describe it, and make the game look nice.</p>

<p>Let’s think about what elements we need in our game. First of all, you need a playing <strong>field</strong>: let it contain 8 columns and 9 rows. Position the cells to form straight rows and columns: give a <code class="java"><em>className</em></code> to the whole field and  <code class="java">className=”cell”</code> to all cells, then you can easily position them with <code class="java">display flex</code>. Note: since there are a lot of similar objects, it’s better to use <code class="java">map()</code> instead of hard code. Check out an <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">article on lists and keys</a> to learn how to do it.</p>

<p>Remember, the player needs to find all the mines to win the game, so let's make a <strong>flag counter</strong> that will keep track of the remaining unflagged mines. At the beginning of the game, there are 10 unflagged mines.</p>

<p>Following the original version of Minesweeper, let's also add a <strong>reset button </strong>and a <strong>timer</strong>. Don't forget that when the game hasn’t started yet, the timer should show <samp>0:00</samp>. The reset button should be the only element on which the cursor changes into a pointer.</p>

<p>Great, we have listed the elements of the game! The app should also have a <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">component hierarchy</a>: figure out which components will determine the content of others and how you will pass props. You can decide on the structure by yourself, or use the recommended plan: </p>

<p>The final touch is to add the name "Minesweeper” and improve the game's looks by styling it. For example, you can put a picture near the name and play with colors. Flex your imagination and be creative!</p>

<p>As a result, you’ll see the Minesweeper game that does not work... for now.</p>

<p>Your intermediate solution can be compiled and run in a browser using the <code class="java">npm start</code> command in the WebStorm terminal, to stop the server use <code class="java">Ctrl+C</code>.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Implement components:<br>
	Field 8x9<br>
	Flag counter equal to 10 <br>
	Reset button<br>
	Timer at 0:00 <br>
	Components and the hierarchy</li>
	<li>Add CSS</li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>In a browser, the result of this step will look something like this:</p>
