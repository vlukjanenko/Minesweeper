<h2>Description</h2>

<p>You're more than halfway there, congratulations!</p>

<p>Refresh your knowledge about promises and setInterval; it would also be useful to watch <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Philip Roberts' talk</a> to understand JavaScript event loops. In this stage, you may need to know how to <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">lift state up</a>.</p>

<p>Now, let's make the timer and the flag counter:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The timer should start counting seconds when the player opens the first cell, and stop if they click on a mine.</li>
	<li>The flag counter should show how many flags are left. The value cannot be negative.</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep working on the cells, too: if the opened cell doesn't contain a mine, it should show the number of mines around it. If there are no mines near the just opened cell, the area of cells around it should be opened. Check the examples for better understanding.</p>

<p>Your intermediate solution can be compiled and run in a browser using the <code class="java">npm start</code> command in the WebStorm terminal, to stop the server use <code class="java">Ctrl+C</code>.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Flag counter</li>
	<li>Timer (begins after the first click, stops after a click on a mine)</li>
	<li>Opening cell areas</li>
	<li>Cells show the number of mines around</li>
	<li>Defeat condition</li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p> In a browser, the result of this step will look something like this:</p>
