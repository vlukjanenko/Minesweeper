summary: Minesweeper is an oldschool game that dates back to the earliest mainframe
  games of the 1960s and 1970s. The player is presented with a field of cells, some
  of which contain hidden mines. You can open any of the closed cells and find out
  how many mines are around it, or stumble upon a mine right there and lose. Your
  goal is to open all the empty cells and flag all the cells with mines.<br/><br/>Learn
